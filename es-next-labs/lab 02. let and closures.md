## Lab 2 - let and closures
1. Create an HTML page with 4 buttons with id 'button1', 'button2', 'button3' and 'button4'.

1. Write a loop from 1 to 4 that

	* finds a button(i)
	* adds a listener function to the click event that logs to the console:  
		"You clicked on button " + i

1. Use the `var` keyword to declare the counter for the loop
	* What happens when you click the buttons? Why?

1. Fix it using the `let` keyword.
